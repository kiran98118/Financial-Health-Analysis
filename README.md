# 📊 Financial Analysis - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **cleaning, validating, and preprocessing financial data** to ensure accuracy and consistency before performing financial analysis. The dataset contains **20,000 entries** with key financial metrics like revenue, expenses, profit, cash flow, and liabilities.  

## 🛠️ My Contributions  
- **Data Cleaning & Validation**:  
  - Checked for missing values and handled inconsistencies.  
  - Verified financial calculations (`Profit = Revenue - Expenses`).  
  - Identified and removed outliers using **Z-score and IQR methods**.  
  - Standardized date formats and ensured chronological ordering.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Generated summary statistics (`df.describe()`) to understand distributions.  
  - Used **box plots** and **heatmaps** to detect anomalies.  
  - Analyzed correlations between revenue, expenses, and profitability.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Created new columns for **Year-over-Year Growth** in revenue and profit.  
  - Converted `Date` column into **year-based aggregation** for trend analysis.  

## 📥 Dataset Summary  
- **Columns:** Revenue, Expenses, Profit, Cash Flow, Debt, Assets, Liabilities, Marketing Spend, Employee Count, Tax Paid, Operational Cost  
- **Data Type Check:** Ensured correct data types (`int`, `float`, `datetime`).  
- **Outliers Handling:** Used Z-score and found no extreme values.  
- **Data Accuracy:** Validated calculations; no discrepancies found.  

## 📊 Key Findings  
✔ **No missing values** detected.  
✔ **Profit distribution is symmetrical** (Skewness ~ 0).  
✔ **Strong correlation** between Cash Flow and Profit.  
✔ **Assets are significantly higher than Liabilities**, indicating financial stability.  
✔ **Revenue and Expenses fluctuate over time**, suggesting seasonal variations.  

## 📜 Next Steps  
- **Implement Predictive Analysis**: Forecast future revenue/profit trends.  
- **Automate Data Cleaning Pipelines** for real-time financial monitoring.  
- **Develop Interactive Dashboards** using Tableau/Power BI.
